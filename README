REASONING:
	* Reddit is massive code wise and resource wise.
	* Hacker News won't run for me on arc
	* I want a platform to implement my ideas for what reddit should be.

Guidelines:
	* Will be python
	* Will try and be light on external software
	* Will be FOSS
	* Will focus on offering options other than centralized communities (Select your own filter layer)
